Hello there, This is Pragalbha Patil. I am a software & web developer. I love to read about and Hacking & Pentesting and I've participated in many CTFs to put my knowledge to challenge. I keep learning about better software development practices & I often code in Java, Javascript or PHP. I wanted to have a blog since very long to write about the stuff I know and get your feedback. I hope you enjoy reading my blog!
